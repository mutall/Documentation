The Documentation directory for the Library and Outlook classes. The code described here is for documentation purposes only and **SHOULD** not be compiled to run.
The main Documentation libraries used are:

*The use of the reflection class in PHP and TypeScript is not yet implemented, but in the event it is needed, it will eventually be added*
